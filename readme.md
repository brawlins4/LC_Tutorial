This tutorial was developed in collaboration with Georgetown College students Sabera Daqiq and Wence Peraza as part of a class project for CSC 450.  The original repository can be found on Sabera's Github page https://github.com/Sara3/LRC_bookquiz.  It is designed to provide our library student assistants with an introduction and tutorial on the Library of Congress Classification system to reinforce the training they recieve before shelving materials.  It consists of three levels where books will need to be placed in order before proceeding to the next level.
